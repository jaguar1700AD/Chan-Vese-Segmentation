A semi-implicit gradient descent algorithm coded in Octave to solve the Chan-Vese Image Segmentation problem. 

Chan-Vese models segmentation as a minimization problem, which is then solved via curve evolution through level set methods. This process reduces the minimization problem to solving a PDE numerically.

The file "report.pdf" contains all the project details.
